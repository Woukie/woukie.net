    <h1>Teleblock Updates</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: Found the plugin, and the map.</p>
    <p>UPDATE: nvm the map was from a really old version of the gamemode.</p>

    <p></p>
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: Found an early version of the main hub that linked all the servers together, it doesn't have half the flying saucers or the detailed section below spawn but it's definitley the one.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/Teleblock/og_hub.webp" alt="Hub 1" />

    <img src="/assets/img/Teleblock/og_hub_2.webp" alt="Hub 2" />
    <p></p>
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: Found what appears to be a super early build of the map in an AMP server backup archive titled 'Untreat' for whatever reason there are production plugins on the server.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Gonna move this to a new page since this has become a whole search effort, and clean up the grammar a bit.</p>
    <p>Currently going through random files on my backup hard drives, just started 3 concurrent searches for keywords that could help find the original map. I have no idea if the world file still exists but I really hope it does.</p>
    <p>Just realised I can look at the plugin code to see what the world file name would have been and just do a search for that.</p>
    <p>Turns out the plugin is also so old that it doesn't even load worlds, it just teleports blocks. I've now done a search for 'latest.txt' in hopes of finding all the Minecraft worlds.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: Found an unrelated really old world that was apart of untreat that I completley forgot about.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/Teleblock/side_quest.webp" alt="Side quest" />
    <p></p>
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: I just did an entire search for latest.txt instead of latest.log. Kill me.</p>
