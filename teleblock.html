    <h1>Teleblock</h1>
    <p>
      The whole gimmick was that blocks teleported when you broke them, hence the name. Do you get why it's called Teleblock? It's called TELE-block because the BLOCKS get TELE-ported. That's why it's called TELE-BLOCK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The premise was simple, players break blocks to get points, kill players to steal points and use points to get power ups and upgrade their tools. A pretty simple loop that lead to some pretty fun gameplay, no player could get much of an edge and anyone could turn the game around at any moment so it was incredibly intense. Kind of like Mario Cart in that sense, especailly with all the powerups I added.

      It also took place on a huge vertical collumn of a floating island, which took up half the development time to make. It had mines, a volcano, a mushroom layer, a deep dark, hidden rooms, a hot spring, camp sites and lots of attention to detail.

      As you played, events caused the world to get destroyed around you, with the severity and frequency of events increasing as time went on. Games got really chaotic, and it was fun to see the world get completley destroyed around you.

      This project took weeks to complete and test. It was integrated into a larger server with other games of similar effort. I' a'm trying to find the project files and If I find them I'll put it on GitHub.

      When I think of this project, I'm incredibly nostalgic about it, It's a shame I can't find the map anywhere.

    <p>UPDATE: Found the plugin, and the map</p>
    <p>UPDATE: nvm the map was from a really old version of the gamemode</p>

    <p>UPDATE: Found an early version of the main hub that linked all the servers together, it doesn't have half the flying saucers or the detailed section below spawn but it's definitley the one</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/Teleblock/og_hub_2.webp" alt="Hub 2" />
    <hr/>
    <p>UPDATE: Found what appears to be a super early build of the map in an AMP server backup archive titled 'Untreat' for whatever reason there are production plugins on the server</p>

    <p>Gonna move this to a new page since this has become a whole search effort, and clean up the grammar a bit.</p>
    <p>Currently going through random files on my backup hard drives, just started 3 concurrent searches for keywords that could help find the original map. I have no idea if the world file still exists but I really hope it does</p>
    <p>Just realised I can look at the plugin code to see what the world file name would have been and just do a search for that</p>
