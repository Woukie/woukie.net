    <p>
      Here are the projects that people who know me as 'Woukie' might be interested in. I'm not going to list every project I've ever made, just the ones that I think are worth mentioning.

    <h2>
      Internet Interloper
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leave text and images on any website for others to see! Not public yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even works on silly-billy sites like Amazon that abuse url parameters instead of just following
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">good standards</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that note, I have seen some absolutely barbaric URLs, does Amazon know that browsers have URL character limits? They must know that loading the URL with data is not sustainable. I can't believe that after 30 years of URLs, we still have to deal with this.

      What happened to WoukieBox and WoukieBox 2?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first one was a fun experiment that took 10 mins to make. It went down because I was too lazy to restart the backend whenever we had a power outage
    </p>
    <p>
      The second took 2-3 weeks of my life to develop, and it wasn't just a global chatroom, it had accounts, profile pictures / bios, group chats, DMs, themes, notifications with sound effects, anonymous accounts, a desktop app with an installer, discord-like messages and even had VOIP in the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also using ServerPods. Big mistake, because that meant it was really fucking annoying to update and deploy. I was also programming it like it was going to give me money. It wasn't. So I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Side tangent, why on gods green earth does serverpods not officially support deploying with docker to a VPS?)
