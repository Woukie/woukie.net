      Projects
    </h1>
    <p>
      Here are the projects that people who know me as 'Woukie' might be interested in. I'm not going to list every project I've ever made, just the ones that I think are worth mentioning.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>
      Modding
    </h2>
    <p>
      I've made a few mods for games. Though I've completley abandoned modding now, I'm still proud of what I've made.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Scrap Mechanic
    </h3>
    <p>
      Made 'Drive', an immitation of 'The Long Drive'. Basically survival code stripped back a lot. Most of the work with this went into rewriting world generation and loading between worlds during gameplay. I wouldn't play it myself, but it's got like ten thousand downloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other main one is 'Scrapfarer' which is a recreation of the genuinely awful Roblox game 'Build a Boat for Treasure'. The motivation behind the project was to change the gameplay loop of the game, since I don't see that much in modding communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite being more work, it's nowhere near as good as Drive (often the case with these projects). It's way too buggy and not well paced, but that hasn't stopped Scrapman making 5 whole videos on it, along with other YouTubers, which caused it to get four thousand downloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also made a mod that adds loot boxes to the game, we don't talk about that.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ROUNDS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Added web image support to another persons map editor mod in order to put pictures of my friends in the game. Also made a family guy themed map. ~200,000 downloads. Quite frankly I'm surprised it got that many downloads.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Minecraft
    </h3>
    <p>
      ShrinkRays, Lost Idols, Protein, Shearable Coral and ShrinkDevices, ~27,000 downloads. I will not update them to 1.x.x.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Internet Interloper
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leave text and images on any website for other interlopers.

    <h2>
      What happened to WoukieBox and WoukieBox 2?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first one was a fun experiment that took 10 mins to make. It went down because it wasn't very active, and I forgot about it after a power outage so the backend just died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second took 2-3 weeks of my life to develop, and it wasn't just a global chatroom, it had accounts, profile pictures / bios, group chats, DMs, themes, notifications with sound effects, anonymous accounts, a desktop app with an installer, discord-like messages and even had VOIP in the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also using ServerPods. Big mistake, because that meant it was really fucking annoying to update and deploy (I was deploying to a VPS with docker which they only parially support). I was also programming it like it was going to give me money. It wasn't. So I stopped.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Roblox
    </h2>
    <p>
      I regret everything I have ever done on Roblox.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Cube
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Cube is a game where you throw rocks at a big floating cube. Progression was based off Lumber Tycoon 2, with plots, trucks, shops, and having the player progress through projectiles. Had quite a technically interesting system for subdividing the cube as it was destroyed, but due to Roblox collision detection code it was a bit buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was even a science mechancic where players could infuse and combine projectiles to get different effects. There weren't too many players, but I attribute this mechanic to the fact that a wiki was being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      I even made 5 different music tracks for the shops with different themes and every model was custom made/painted. Progression was a bit slow and it wasn't obvious what some things did. The game was 'finished', it just didn't get much attention so I never updated it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      WASPs
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Trello board for this looked insane, the sheer ammount of work and time that this sucked from me is crazy looking back on it. This is the reason I regret Roblox development.
    </p>
    <p>
      A red vs blue attack/defend style game. Defenders protect a 'core' from melee attacks by killing attackers (or wait around the core) to collect money to spend on upgrading and buying blocks. Featured custom models and sound effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was never finished, the prototype was released for people watching the devlogs.

    <h2>
      Misc
    </h2>
    <p>
      I've made a few other things that don't need whole sections.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ice Climbers, a GMTK game. Was fun to make and I look back on it fondly. I always think back on it whenever I'm in a rut and need to remember I can actually work fast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minecraft plugins, maps, servers, mods and minigames, mainly for Bukkit, Fabric, Paper and Nukkit.
      </li>
    </ul>
