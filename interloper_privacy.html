    <h1>Interloper Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Notes are stored on a database with the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Auth ID</b>. A key, randomly-generated by the client that gets sent with each request. This does not change between messages sent on the same browser</li>
      <li><b>Text</b>. The text content of a message</li>
      <li><b>Position</b>. The X and Y position of the message</li>
      <li><b>A note ID</b>. A generated ID, accessible to everyone</li>
      <li><b>A timestamp</b>. The time the note was left, visible to everyone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As to have deletions, and have username changes reflect on all notes (not just future ones) the auth ID is stored against a username in an accounts table, you choose to create the username as all usernames are 'Interloper' by default. The accounts table has the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Auth ID</b>. The same key as above</li>
      <li><b>Username</b>. The username of the user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The auth ID, username and all note data could be considered personally identifiable information. All information is stored for functional purposes only and is not shared with any third parties (nor is it used for analysis by me).
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, notes are public. If you want to remove a note, you can delete it so long as you are authenticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not disclose your auth ID to anyone, as it is the only thing stopping someone from deleting all your notes. Additionally, if you lose your authID, you will lose the ability to delete your notes.
