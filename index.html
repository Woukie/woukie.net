                A well known fact within the animal kingdom is that those who posess a wide vision are known as 'prey', and those with a narrow vision are known as 'predators'.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a troubling fact that a small subset of programmers have evolved to have a wide vision, sometimes to the extent where they require expensive curved monitors that stretch around their head just to meet the constraints of their flawed design.

                WoukieNet is a paradise for programmers that don't consider themselves to be part of this subset. By entering the site, you acknowledge that you accept 4:3 as the god-given aspect ratio.
