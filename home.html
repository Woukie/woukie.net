    <h1>Welcome to Blue Oasis 2025</h1>
    <p>
      Blue Oasis 2025 is an archive and showcase of my hobby projects.

      Much has changed from the original WoukieNet, for instance, we're now on GitHub pages using Jekyll, the site flows better and I removed WoukieBox. Don't worry though, it still uses
      <a href="https://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/v2.3.1/">BOOTSTRA.386</a>.
